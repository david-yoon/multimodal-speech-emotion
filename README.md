----------

### [requirements]
	tensorflow==1.4 (tested on cuda-8.0, cudnn-6.0)
	python==2.7
	scikit-learn==0.20.0
	nltk==3.3


### [download data corpus]
- IEMOCAP <a href="https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/iemocap_release.htm">[link]</a>
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-008-9076-6">[paper]</a>
- download IEMOCAP data from its original web-page (license agreement is required)


### [preprocessed-data schema (our approach)]
- <a href="https://forms.gle/4qV4BgXDMz4UoYxe8">Get the preprocessed dataset [application link]</a>
	>If you want to download the "preprocessed dataset," please ask the license to the IEMOCAP team first.
- for the preprocessing, refer to codes in the "./preprocessing"
- We cannot publish ASR-processed transcription due to the license issue (commercial API), however, we assume that it is moderately easy to extract ASR-transcripts from the audio signal by oneself. (we used google-cloud-speech-api)

- Format of the data for our experiments:<br>
	> MFCC : MFCC features of the audio signal (ex. train_audio_mfcc.npy) <br>
	[#samples, 750, 39] - (#sampels, sequencs(max 7.5s), dims) <br>

	> MFCC-SEQN : valid lenght of the sequence of the audio signal (ex. train_seqN.npy)<br>
	[#samples] - (#sampels) <br>
	
	> PROSODY : prosody features of the audio signal (ex. train_audio_prosody.npy) <br>
	> [#samples, 35] - (#sampels, dims) <br>
	
	> TRANS : sequences of trasnciption (indexed) of a data (ex. train_nlp_trans.npy) <br>
	[#samples, 128] - (#sampels, sequencs(max)) <br>

	> LABEL : targe label of the audio signal (ex. train_label.npy) <br> 
	[#samples] - (#sampels) <br>
    

### [source code]
- repository contains code for following models
	 > Audio Recurrent Encoder (ARE) <br>
	 > Text Recurrent Encoder (TRE) <br>
	 > Multimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder (MDRE) <br>
	 > Multimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder with Attention (MDREA) <br>

----------

### [training]
- refer "reference_script.sh"
- fianl result will be stored in "./TEST_run_result.txt" <br>
